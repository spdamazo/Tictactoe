Assignment 1: Games

Overview
Create a simple game application.

Directions
Start by selecting the type of game you would like to implement. Some options are listed below along with their functional requirements. If there is a different type of game you would like to work on, check with your instructor for assignment scope (there are many other great choices, but anything too large should be considered for the term project).
In all cases, the game does not have to be complex, but should be playable. Players should also be able to start a new round of the game without restarting the application. Submit your game project.

Tic Tac Toe
Create an application that allows 2 players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. Players alternate turns placing either an X or an O. If a player gets 3 in a row, they win. If all 9 spaces on the board are filled with no winner, the game is a draw.
